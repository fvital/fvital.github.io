excerpt: 'The truck industry transports most of the shipments in the USA. Nevertheless, the available parking infrastructure is considerably below the industry needs. The combination of parking shortage and scarcity of timely availability information hinders accurate trip planning, leading to unexpected situations
and pushing drivers to park in illegal and potentially dangerous locations or to drive beyond the legal
time limit. While there have been considerable efforts and technology developments in smart parking
for passenger vehicles, truck parking technologies are lagging behind when it comes to development and implementation. This paper gives an overview of the current state of research on intelligent truck parking, including related studies on urban passenger vehicle parking. The surveyed work includes sensing infrastructure, resource allocation, demand and prediction models, and routing and scheduling. In addition, real data was used to compare simple historical average methods with some predictive models and illustrate the latterâ€™s advantage.'
