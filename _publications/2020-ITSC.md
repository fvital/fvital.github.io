title: "Truck Routing under Rest Area Parking Constraints"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/2020-ITSC
excerpt: 'Truck drivers often have difficulty finding appropriate rest locations due to truck parking shortages, which can significantly impact drivers' safety, industry costs, and the environment. Nevertheless, the lack of truck parking availability information makes it hard to account for parking during planning, leading research on truck routing and scheduling to usually assume that parking facilities are always available. In this paper, we propose a model that accounts for parking availability when planning long-haul truck shipments in addition to working hours constraints. The proposed method plans a minimum cost path and schedule such that the itinerary is regulation-compliant, and parking is guaranteed at all scheduled stops. The problem is modeled as a resource-constrained shortest path problem, and a label correcting algorithm is used to find a near-optimal solution. Computational experiments are used to compare the cost of solutions that use parking availability information with ones that do not by simulating drivers' behavior when parking is not available. Results show that, when parking constraints are imposed, parking availability levels can significantly affect costs. However, if irregular parking potential costs are factored in, the prevented penalty costs can exceed (or at least partially offset) the cost increase caused by parking constraints.'
