Education
======
* Ph.D in Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, 2021 (expected)
* M.S. in Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, 2016
* M.S. in Engineering (Generalist), Ecole Centrale Paris, 2014
* B.S. in Control and Automation Engineering, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, 2014

Experience
======
* 8/2016-current: Research Assistant
  * USC's Center for Advanced Transportation Technologies, Los Angeles, CA
  * Responsible for design and implementation of algorithms, writing of proposals, reports and scientific publications, and managing projects from start to finish. Most research projects focused on improving routing and scheduling methods for long-haul trucking.
  * Wrote 3 accepted proposals and 5 papers accepted in major conferences and journals.
  * Implemented estimation models to predict truck parking availability based on data, as well as scripts to gather data online;
  * Developed safer planning algorithms by accounting for working hours regulations and parking availability information;
  * Improved efficiency of commercial electric trucks by coordinating battery, regulation and parking constraints;
  * Developed dynamic pricing mechanisms to coordinate truck parking demand and alleviate parking shortages.
  * Other projects included developing a cooperative lane-changing driver model with safety spacing calculation, and developing traffic simulation models for traffic control.


* 8/2016-05/2019: Teaching Assistant
  * University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA
  * Prepared lessons and lab experiments according to course outline to convey all required material and deepen student understanding of subject matter.
  * Mentored students through office hours and one-on-one communication.
  * Courses taught:
    * Linear Control Systems
    * Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Electrical Engineers
    * Linear Systems

* 02/2013 - 04/2014: Research Intern
  * Universidade Federal Do Rio De Janeiro, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil
  * Set up mobile robotics platform using motorized wheelchair, LiDAR, ROS and Arduino.
  * Integrated wheelchair with a neural signal interpreting system, and used it to control the wheelchair.

* 08/2013 - 03/2014: Research Intern
  * Universidade Federal Do Rio De Janeiro, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil
  * Developed computer vision algorithm for automated inspection of submerged pipelines;
  * Used Hough transform and Canny edge detector variant to identify pipeline in inspection videos and DCT-based texture analysis to identify damaged sections.
